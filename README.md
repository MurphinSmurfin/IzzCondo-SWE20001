# IzzCondo-(SWE20001 Managing Software Projects) 

This project is the effort of INTI International College Subang Jaya students (Group 12 - C1 AUG2023) in conjunction with the SWE20001 Managing Software Projects. Group members are Hiew Wei Lik, Izz Danish, Kong Cheng Fung, Leong Chor Yin, and Vickramraaj Chan.

Izz Condominium Services is a serviced apartment based in Kuala Lumpur. The condominium finished its renovation and has introduced some new facilities which caused a surge of booking requests. This caused considerable confusion with the paper-based system record.

In short, this project aims to create an application that can streamline the process of receiving requests of multiple categories as well as a more efficient way of handling requests. An easy-to-learn and use application must be produced so that those who are not technologically advanced can also benefit from the application.

This project is mainly targeted for 3 users (Administrators, Employees, and Tenants), and it has 10 backlog items (to be revised). Each member are restricted to only performing actions according to their authority level.
